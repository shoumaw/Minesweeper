A clone of the Minesweeper game


Due to the simplicity of this game, only 3 components were needed (BOARD,CELL,MODAL). No proper architecture was needed.


Refs were used in the design also its not recommended as it goes against the flow of REACT but it seemed suitable for the logic of this game (A board with refs to its cells)
